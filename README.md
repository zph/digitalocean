# DigitalOcean API in Ruby

If you found this by Googling, you might be in the wrong place. Go to [digital_ocean](https://github.com/rmoriz/digital_ocean) instead or install their Gem from RubyGems.  Their code is more established and tested.  

##You've been warned.

## Getting started

This is an _ALPHA_ library for wrapping the DigitalOcean VPS API in `Ruby` for my own use.  This is not tested or ready for production. This is a project for fun and might/will be dropped when I no longer need the functionality.

But if you find something useful in here, cool!

## Getting started

Install via `Bundler`
Explore library in your favorite REPL (hint: Use Pry Gem)
